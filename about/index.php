      <p>This website was made so people can learn a lesson from my life. Parents should definitely tell their child(ren) about their diagnosis. It's very important so they can know why things are the way they are. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aspergerexperts.com/blogs/entry/25-defense-mode-why-people-with-aspergers-seem-stuck-shutdown-so-often/">Defense mode</a> is a very important thing to understand both for the parent and the child. Also, don't look at the DSM. Instead, look at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aspergerexperts.com/">www.aspergerexperts.com</a>. They have everything there including resourses, explanations, forums, coaching, therapy, etc.</p>
      <p>I recommend professionals look at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.aspergerexperts.com/products/courses/deep-into-defense-mode/">this defense mode course</a> to understand that people can look like they're doing things just to be mean but really, they're in defense mode and just scared.</p>
