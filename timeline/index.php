          <p itemprop="description">I was on the school bus to Yeshiva Darchei Torah and everyone on the bus was making trouble except for me. I kept to myself unlike everyone else. When the bus got to Darchei, the bus driver said "get off the bus you trouble-makers!". I took the bus driver literally and stayed on. The bus driver thought that everyone was off the bus and drove away. A few blocks past Darchei, the bus driver saw that I was still on the bus and asked me what school I go to and I said "Darchei" and the bus driver drove me back to Darchei. From then on, I made myself very noticable and started making trouble everywhere I went so something like this wouldn't happen again.</p>

          <h3 itemprop="name">Camp Kaylie</h3>
          <p itemprop="description">Finally went to my first sleep-away camp. This camp is for people with all abilities mixing in mainstream and special needs kids. Unfortunately, I got obsessed with the "Waving Flags" song and people in my bunk got annoyed at me.</p>

          <h3 itemprop="name">Camp Kaylie</h3>
          <p itemprop="description">Went to Camp Kaylie again. I was very hyperactive there like I always was. I was doing pranks on people that summer and people got annoyed at me again. I just didn't understand the concept of friends. I was just bored and if only I knew that I can get positive attention, I would have the same fun but happier and other people would be happy with me as well.</p>

          <h3 itemprop="name">YALA school in torah v'dath</h3>
          <p itemprop="description">Switched schools to the special needs YALA from the mainstream Darchei. Finally found out that I have autism after my parents have been hiding it from me all these years. It finally explained why I was different from everyone else. It was revealed to me from a paper of other people's diagnosis hanging around. I didn't understand anything about what a real friend was. I had people pretending to be my friend in the mainstream school, Yeshiva Darchei Torah, that I switched from. I thought that friends were just boring people. There was someone else on the autism spectrum that wanted to be my friend (for real). The problem is that he didn't give me space (I have that problem also) and got uncomfortable with him. I was wondering why I was always being lumped together with this person. I didn't know what autism was until a year later. I went to far with what I did by bullying him. I never knew that there was such a thing as people needing space. I feel ashamed of myself for what I did to him. That school, YALA, closed down because of mis-communication from staff. If only the staff could explain to me what was going on and what autism actually is but they didn't. They just treated me and the other person I was bullying as troublemakers.</p>

          <p itemprop="description">I was still mad at that person for not giving me space. I just didn't know how to express myself. I kept bothering that person and no one knew how to get through to me. In addition, I just got on medication for the first time and got curious about other people's medications and began looking at their medications which got people mad at me. If only I would get the concept of what friends are. I came home from camp not knowing why things are the way they were and why that person I bullied was fully on my mind and had more privileges than me. I was all rigid and mad. If only I knew why...</p>

          <p itemprop="description">My parents realized that I was really special needs and looked at another camp for me and finally found Camp Chaverim. I finally made two friends there (for real this time (Yes, it took me until the last day of camp to appreciate those two friends.)). Finally, I understood myself much better. You need to be nice to people and get positive attention in order to be happy.</p>

          <p itemprop="description">Switched to another special needs school hoping to fix my mistakes and make friends. I had a successful first day but things turned bad after the weekend. I became hyperactive and stamped things all over my property and face. The person next to me got mad and turned the whole school against me. This got me into defense mode and made it look like I was mean to other people. I started obsessing over my best friend I made in Camp Chaverim, which in return, annoyed other people.</p>

          <p itemprop="description">Unfortunately this year, things took a step back. My best friend got upset that I was obsessed with him (someone from IVDU Upper School also goes to Camp Chaverim and told him). No one liked that I was being immature as well.

          <p itemprop="description">I tried to keep my cool for a month but everyone ignored me. I entered defense mode again and took zero tolerance from anyone now that I had no friends at all.

          <p itemprop="description">My father told me that if I behave myself and not act out, then I get my own expensive desktop computer. I behaved myself for a week (pretty much keeping to myself). Then I overheard a bunkmate tell my counselor that he was on the autism spectrum and started misbehaving again thinking that autism was a behavior disorder (I didn't know what autism really was still). That person got mad at me to my surprise. I entered defense mode again and did everything I did from 2014 again and looked at other people's medications. That got everyone in the camp mad at me. This time, I knew who everyone was because I was more aware of myself. I was going in circles with my two counselors about why I can't make any friends. If only I knew what autism really was. This was my last social event with people my functioning level ever (hopefully until I move out of my parents house). I pretty much ruined my reputation everywhere at that point.</p>

He checked my ears and saw nothing in it and told me that i'm having a sensation and that I should take 2 Advil pills. Me and my father went back home to the meal and I tool 2 Advil pills. Right when I took it, I started feeling unbalanced. I told my mother that "I feel like i'm moving but i'm not moving". My mother said to me: "Oh my gosh! do you have Vertigo!?". I asked her what that is and she told me it's about being dizzy. I asked her what causes it and she told me that she doesn't know that much about it.
